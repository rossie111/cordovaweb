      Cordova Web started with a simple idea of building a relationship with our local market in hopes to request more organic vegetables. With both our history in food organizing, we wanted to go about this in a thoughtful, conscious way. This led to much deeper discussions on how to be involved in one's community, what the role of the individual is, and what our role was, and what the role of a neighborhood plays in a city that has been quickly gentrified, and continues to change throughout the pandemic. We wanted to create a lasting relationship that benefited both the health of the community, and the health of Cordova Market.</p>
      
      <p>We started by meeting online, mostly due to the pandemic, but also because we wanted to start with researching basic facts about our neighborhood. This was interesting, but ultimately we decided the best way to get involved in the neighborhood was to physically go outside. We met outside Cordova market, to observe the surroundings and sketch. </p>

      <p>Quick sketching is a method typically applied to figure drawing that allows an artist to familiarize themselves with the object of their focus.  This is done in 1, 2, 5, and 10 minute intervals, respectively.  Each second is an opportunity of intimacy that forces an artist to really focus on the most key elements of an object, and in this particular case: a market.</p>
