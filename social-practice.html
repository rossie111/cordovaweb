				<h1>SOCIAL PRACTICE</h1>
				
			
				<p>As food sovereignty organizers, experimental geographers, and visual artists, our framework is rooted in thinking critically about the production of space/land and the potential for art to be transformative.</p>

				
				<p>Cordova Web explores how to be involved in one's community, what our role as artists is, and what the role of a neighborhood plays in a city that is being gentrified, and continues to change throughout the pandemic.</p>

				
				<p>From these discussions, we decided the best way to get involved in the neighborhood was to physically go outside. We met outside Cordova market, to observe the surroundings and sketch. While outside, we had engaging converstations with our neighbors, community members, and workers of Cordova Market.</p>

				
				<p>Next we furthered the project by creating an interactive piece. On November 3rd, 2020 we hosted a "ritual" that involved community members "mapping" their connection to Cordova Market on a neighborhood map with glow in the dark yarn. The helped illustrate our local interdependence as we imagine new ways to weave together food, space, and community engagement in a politics of care.</p>
