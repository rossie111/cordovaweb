				<blockquote><p><i>"My favorite metaphor is the spider and its web.</p> 

				<p>So extended cognition researchers at MIT have been showing—there's new research every day pretty much—that spiders’ cognition is not in its brain or its body,  [but] extends into its web.  And if you damage part of the web, it acts as if it has had a stroke. Human beings are like this—like most animals have some amount of extended cognition.</p>

				<p>What I like to think is that because we are only self through other, through constant intaking of otherness to very materially metabolically build our bodies; … our minds are not in our head. Minds are characters we inhabit—that multiple beings inhabit… 

				<p>That's why the therapeutic model sometimes seems too small for me.  Like if a mind is a territory that many beings are inside of, how can two human beings in the sterile room solve the problem that is constituted by a whole web of wild kin?"</i></p></blockquote>
